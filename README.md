This along with its "DisposableVM" functionality and whonix setup by default; means unless you want to use TailsOS, this is your safest bet (https://www.qubes-os.org/)

## Great cyber security feeds
### Paid
  - Falcon Feeds: Would love an option to sign-in without having to dig out my google account but, it is beautifully presented information with a great threat feed. I must say, my favourite aspect is the way it tracks ransomware groups. Also this has a great index page mouse interaction functionality (https://falconfeeds.io/)
  - Feedly: It's chat AI chat report capability is quite unique, and you can select a wide array of cyber security aspects to focus on for a more personalised feed. (https://feedly.com/)

## Hardware
  - HackRF One w/ H4M Mayhem Module: Software defined radio with portable pentest ability (https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/) + (https://opensourcesdrlab.com/products/h4m-receiver-and-spectrum-analyzer?VariantsId=10129)
  - Wi-Fi Pineapple Mark VII (+AC Tactical): Pre-built feature packed Wi-Fi hacking tool (https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992)
  - NanoVNA-F V3: A great relatively cheap portable Vectore Network Analyzer, which allows for validating how your antenna performs at your required frequency range, and it's connection to the intended device (https://opensourcesdrlab.com/products/nanovna-f-v3)
### Avoid
  - ESP32-Div: This sits here for now, I love the product concept but it has poor design choices when I bought one. The USB-C appears to feed 5V straight into the 18650 to charge it which is a potentially dangerous design, along with broken firmware apon arrival. It also had a daughter board torn off at the pads during shipping due to poor mechanical strain consideration in its design. However I hope these are revised as the core product principle is great, it is essentially a portable ESP32 with additional RF modules to provide parallel usage, and it was relatively cheap which allows it fit nicely into an under-served market niche. I am certain these issues can be remediated without intensive cost increase! For now this is cannot be purchased where I did as after reporting my findings to the store, they provided me a full refunded and pulled the products availability so as of 20251207 it is "SOLD OUT" (https://opensourcesdrlab.com/products/esp32-div)
